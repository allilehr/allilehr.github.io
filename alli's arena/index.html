	<p><h2>My thoughts & other random super cool things I think the world should know about.</h2></p>
	<section id="content">
		<p>I’ve got a lot of ideas… I’m sure everyone does but since I took a coding class and can make my own website I get to post them online! Look at me go!!! No but really I have a lot of different interests and hobbies and I decided that I wanted to create a place to post some of them. My favorite of said hobbies, reflected in the menu bar above, are really Style & Fashion, Travel, and Movies. However, I would like to give a solid shoutout to the Politics section because I’m hoping this will turn out to be a pretty cool page. Although I have historically not really been too interested in politics, I have a newfound interest ever since I moved to NYC due to the following:</p>
			<li>I realized as a 25 year old I should know something about the way the country I live in is being run</li>
			<li>my best friend wants to be the President</li>
			<li>I watched the first half of Season 1 of House of Cards</li>
		<p>All of these things made me realize that politics and the people involved in them are probably pretty interesting and that it should be more important to everyone. Yes, I know, there are plenty of you out there that already know A TON about politics, the way our country is run, the policies and bills, etc. You guys are awesome and more people should be like you!!! However, a large group of peeps (like me a few years ago) just don’t care at all unless you’re a celebrity / on the front of a magazine / a Victoria’s Secret model. (PS absolutely not hating on celebs or models at all like I legit love you all and think you’re amazing, esp you Taylor, Karlie, Cara, Lily, Gigi, I am a huge fan and want to be part of your squad like for realz)</p>
		<p>Anyways… case in point being that if our politicians were as important / well known as our celebrities more people in the states would be interested in what they are saying, follow current events, be better informed, and hopefully help influence our futures. I can promise you that I am not an expert but I'm definitely going to try to follow the 2016 Presidential Campaign more closely than ever before and try to post some interesting stuff!</p>
